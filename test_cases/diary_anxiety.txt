I'm feeling extremely anxious and stressed today. My heart is racing and I can't stop worrying about everything. I feel overwhelmed by all the things I need to do and my mind won't stop racing with worst-case scenarios. I'm having trouble breathing normally and feel very tense. I need something to help me calm down and feel more grounded. The worry is consuming me.
