I can't focus on anything today. My mind keeps jumping from one thing to another and I feel so restless. I started three different tasks but couldn't finish any of them. I'm getting distracted by every little sound and movement around me. I feel frustrated because I want to be productive but my attention keeps wandering. I need help improving my focus and concentration.
