I had another flashback today and it brought back so much emotional pain. I feel triggered by unexpected things and it's hard to feel safe. The memories keep coming back and I feel like I'm reliving those difficult moments. I'm struggling with trust and feeling disconnected from people around me. I want to heal from this trauma but it feels overwhelming. I need help processing these emotions and finding peace.
