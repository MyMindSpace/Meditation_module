I haven't been sleeping well for weeks. I lie in bed for hours but can't fall asleep, my mind won't shut off. When I finally do sleep, I wake up multiple times during the night and feel exhausted in the morning. I'm so tired during the day but then when bedtime comes, I'm wide awake again. This insomnia is affecting everything - my mood, my work, my relationships. I desperately need better sleep.
